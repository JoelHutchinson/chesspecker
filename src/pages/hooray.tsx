					We are happy to announce that the chesspecker tool has been revived.
					The creators of Chesspecker shut down the service due to rising server
					costs. The new team is dedicated to keeping the service alive and
					improving it. Therefore, we have made the decision to run ads on the
					website to cover the server costs. This should ensure that the service
					is self-sufficient regardless of how many users it has, and can be
					used by everyone for free.
